# Log-V_Ver
An open source desktop utility application for viewing/monitoring the log files.


As a developer, we all know how difficult to go through the good-old-log-files and to get out the required/essential information out of it.

This utility app's goal is to remove this difficulty and make viewing the log files as an easy task.
